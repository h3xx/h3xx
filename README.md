# Give Up GitHub

I have given up GitHub. ([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up GitHub* site for details](https://giveupgithub.org).)

You can now find me at:
- https://codeberg.org/h3xx
- https://gitlab.com/h3xx
- https://notabug.org/h3xx

Any use of my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of my code in Copilot.

Join me; you can [give up GitHub](https://giveupgithub.org) too!
